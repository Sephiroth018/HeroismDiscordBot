# HeroismDiscordBot
A discord bot mainly for the World of Warcraft guild Heroism-Antonidas(EU), but the architecture is setup so others could use it too (only the texts for output to discord are currently hardcoded, will be changed soon).

It has multiple functions:
* Notify people about characters joining or leaving the guild
* Let people search for characters in the guild, giving them information about specs, iLvl, alts, (soon also discord user)
* Notify people about the current mystic affixes
* Soon: Notify people about certain world quests
* Soon: Notify people about guild events from the ingame calendar (and invitation state changes)
